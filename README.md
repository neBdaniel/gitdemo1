### Attendance Monitoring System
The attendance system is used to track employees' attendance and movement during working hours and to prepare materials for wage processing.
Using an attendance system will allow you to reduce the number of errors that occur when processing attendance data, make better use of working hours by improving the quality of employees' personal approach to work duties (increase in work morale), and prevent unjustified overtime claims.
